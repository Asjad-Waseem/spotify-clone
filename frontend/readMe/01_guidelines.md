# Instructions

Your app must have user authentication.

This should already be implemented by your solution to the "Authenticate Me" project.

- Sign Up
- Login / Logout
- Demo User Login button.

Your app must have at least two major CRUD features in addition to user authentication.

- The Required feature listed in the project list MUST have complete CRUD. (Create, Read, Update, AND Delete)

```sh
Spot - create, read, update, and delete
```

- Second feature should have a minimum of Create, Read & Delete.

```sh
Reviews - create, read, and delete
```

## Front-end must be built with the following for every feature:

```sh
React
Redux
CSS
FontAwesome for icons (cannot use Material UI)
Google Fonts for fonts


- Your site must be intuitive to the user. User must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.
- You must create a favicon and a title for your app.
- You must have either a landing page or a splash page with proper functionality restricting user access.
```
